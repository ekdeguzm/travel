# Travel Planner App  

This Travel Planner application was developed as part of my midterm Java class. The project features a `Travel` class that manages key travel details, including:  

- **Traveler's name**  
- **Destination**  
- **Trip duration**  
- **Total cost**  
- **Available funds**  

## Features  

- **Budget Calculation** – Computes the daily budget based on total funds and trip duration.  
- **Fund Sufficiency Check** – Determines if the available funds are enough for the trip.  
- **Currency Conversion** – Supports conversions between USD, Euros, and Taiwan Dollars.  
- **Interactive Menu** – A user-friendly, menu-driven interface for seamless interaction.  

## Development and Future Enhancements  

As the sole developer, I designed and integrated all components, improving my **object-oriented programming (OOP) skills** through encapsulation and structured class design. Potential future improvements include:  

- Expanding currency options  
- Adding classes for flights and accommodations
